fiona x eli ( priestess x seer )

START 
" help me!" with no hesitation I sent owl over. My fiona is the most important! Owl is probably going to be angry at me for letting him get spanked in 
place of fiona, but anything for her. Owl returned to my shoulder, with a few feathers missing and his tail bruised. " You kidding me? It was that big spider! You 
let me get spanked by that? I hate you." Owl glared at me and refused to talk to me. Well that's the price I pay. 
I stood by the gates and waited for Fiona. Where is she? I was starting to get panicky,what if that spider caught her?
